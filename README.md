# ASMR Backend Prototype
This project is intended to prototype design ideas for the ASMR backend, to see what problems may be encountered in practice.

## What is ASMR?
ASMR (ASM-Regex) is the temporary name for a project eventually (maybe, hopefully) intended to replace Mixin.

Ideas for ASMR were first discussed publicly in [this Fabric issue](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader/issues/244). The overall idea (having a backend, frontend, compiler and processor) has not changed since then, however specific details have been fleshed out since.

Details of the current design will be published in due course.
